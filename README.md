# tic_tac_toe_v2
A better version of an earlier project I worked on

Stuff that still needs fixing (in order of most to least important):

- make a legitimate rules/info page
- make sure the levels of difficulty are appropriate
- make the page work for mobile as well
- general speedups for the monte carlo tree search
- set_valid is wrong (rip)
- why is it so SLOW
