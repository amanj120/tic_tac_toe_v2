# tic_tac_toe_v2
A better version of an earlier project I worked on

Stuff that still needs fixing (in order of most to least important):

- some way to add a level of difficulty to the game (most likely just the number of trials, will need some fine tuning)
- general speedups for the monte carlo tree search ->optimizing near end game by doing a check to see if there is only a winning or losing situation, experiment with difference between deeper searches vs higher count searches, experiment with counting ties for/against CPU, etc.
- make a legitimate rules/info page
- make the page work fo mobile as well
