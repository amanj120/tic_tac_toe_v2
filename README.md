# tic_tac_toe_v2
A better version of an earlier project I worked on

To Do List:

- make a legitimate rules page
- make a "more info" page to show off all the cool stuff I've done
- use jquery (https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_get_started.asp) to add:
	loading icon when CPU is playing
	
- make sure the levels of difficulty are appropriate
- make the page work for mobile as well -> will eventually have to make the whole board a series of buttons
- GET OPEN MP TO WORK (will see HUGE performance boosts)
- general speedups for the monte carlo tree search
- why is it so SLOW
